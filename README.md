# HARMONY.AI - ðŸ§  A Mental Health AI Chatbot

## Overview
HARMONY.AI is an AI-powered mental health chatbot designed to provide empathetic responses and support to users. It leverages LangChain, ChromaDB, and the Llama-3 model to process and retrieve relevant information from PDF documents.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses LangChain and Llama-3 for intelligent responses.
- **Document Retrieval**: Loads and processes PDF documents for enhanced contextual understanding.
- **Vector Database**: Utilizes ChromaDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Gradio for seamless interaction.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Ensures that conversations remain confidential and secure.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshmitJain10/HARMONY.AI.git
cd Mental-Health-AI-Chatbot
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Chatbot
```bash
python chatbot.py
```

## How It Works
1. **Initialize LLM**: Loads the Llama-3 model using `ChatGroq`.
2. **Create & Load Database**: Scans and processes PDF documents, storing them in ChromaDB.
3. **QA Retrieval Chain**: Uses LangChain to fetch relevant information.
4. **Gradio Interface**: Provides an interactive UI for user interaction.

## Usage
- Open the chatbot interface.
- Ask any mental health-related questions.
- Receive empathetic and well-informed responses.
- Type **"exit"** to end the conversation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for development.
- **LangChain**: For managing LLM interactions.
- **ChromaDB**: For vector-based document retrieval.
- **Gradio**: For creating the chatbot UI.
- **Llama-3**: Large language model for generating responses.
